TileVania is a 2D platformer built with Unity and C#. The game is similar classes NES titles like Super Mario Bros. in it's level design, enemy encounter, and various game mechanics. You are stuck in a dungeon with several levels to overcome, each increasing in difficulty. Traverse the levels and collect as many coins as you can to maximize your score without hitting the enemies.
